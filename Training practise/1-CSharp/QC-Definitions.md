# Definitions that maybe used in 1 on 1's or QC's.( )

1. [Properties] - behave like fields when they are accessed. properties are immplemented with accessors that define when a property is accessed or assigned. meaning Properties do not name the storage locations. Instead, they have accessors that read, write, or compute their values.

2. [Static] - Single command determines wether a mehod or variable belongs to a class as a whole or only as an instance.

3. [Indexers] - Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays. The indexed value can be set or retrieved without explicitly specifying a type or instance member.

4. [Abstract-Modifier]- in a method or property declaration to indicate that the method or property does not contain implementation.

5. [Static-Modifier]- to declare a static member, which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific object.

6. [Constant] - a type declaration is implicitly a static member and connot be modified.

7. [Constructor] - used to initalize the state of an object. must not invoke a return type.

8. [Nullable]- Makes datatypes optional. Enables to datatype to hold value or be used for boolean expressions.You typically use a nullable value type when you need to represent the undefined value of an underlying value type.

9. [Struct] - Unlike classes, struct gets stored in the stack memory so they are more optimized and efficient

10. [Using-Statement] - Helps compiler resolve namespaces, instructs the compiler where to look for references to classes.

11. [Common-Language-Specification]- Defined rules and restricitons that every language must follw for it to run the .Net framework.

12. [Common-Type-System] - The common type system defines how types are declared, used, and managed in the common language runtime, and is also an important part of the runtime's support for cross-language integration

13. [Virtual-Execution-System] - A runtime system of (common language infustructure) which provides an enviorment for executing code.

14. [Arrays] - used to store multiple datatypes and have an index size. Zero-based indexing meaning it will start at position zero

15. [Solution] - The Final Grouping mechanism and will group multiple projects .
    Final Package of your application.

16. [Assembly]- Contains all the files that are actually executable.

17. [Project] - Contains all files that are compiled into an executable, library, etc.

18. [Namespaces] - Logical grouping of classes, must use 'using' keyword to access different classes.

19. [Classes] - They are the building blocks of your code.
They are the blueprints to creating objects that your process in your program
