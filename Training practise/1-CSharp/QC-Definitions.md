# Definitions that maybe used in 1 on 1's or QC's.( )

1. <span style="color: orange;">[Properties]</span> - behave like fields when they are accessed. properties are immplemented with accessors that define when a property is accessed or assigned. meaning Properties do not name the storage locations. Instead, they have accessors that read, write, or compute their values.

2. <span style="color: orange;">[Static]</span> - Single command determines wether a mehod or variable belongs to a class as a whole or only as an instance.

3. <span style="color: orange;">[Indexers]</span> - Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays. The indexed value can be set or retrieved without explicitly specifying a type or instance member.

4. <span style="color: orange;">[Abstract-Modifier]</span>- in a method or property declaration to indicate that the method or property does not contain implementation.

5. <span style="color: orange;">[Static-Modifier]</span> - to declare a static member, which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific object.

6. <span style="color: orange;">[Constant]</span> - a type declaration is implicitly a static member and connot be modified.

7. <span style="color: orange;">[Constructor]</span> - used to initalize the state of an object. must not invoke a return type.

8. <span style="color: orange;">[Nullable]</span> - Makes datatypes optional. Enables to datatype to hold value or be used for boolean expressions.You typically use a nullable value type when you need to represent the undefined value of an underlying value type.

9. <span style="color: orange;">[Struct]</span> - Unlike classes, struct gets stored in the stack memory so they are more optimized and efficient

10. <span style="color: orange;">[Using-Statement]</span> - Helps compiler resolve namespaces, instructs the compiler where to look for references to classes.

11. <span style="color: orange;">[Common-Language-Specification]</span> - Defined rules and restricitons that every language must follw for it to run the .Net framework.

12. <span style="color: orange;">[Common-Type-System]</span> - The common type system defines how types are declared, used, and managed in the common language runtime, and is also an important part of the runtime's support for cross-language integration

13. <span style="color: orange;">[Virtual-Execution-System]</span> - A runtime system of (common language infustructure) which provides an enviorment for executing code.

14. <span style="color: orange;">[Arrays]</span> - used to store multiple datatypes and have an index size. Zero-based indexing meaning it will start at position zero

15. <span style="color: orange;">[Solution]</span> - The Final Grouping mechanism and will group multiple projects .
    Final Package of your application.

16. <span style="color: orange;">[Assembly]</span> - Contains all the files that are actually executable.

17. <span style="color: orange;">[Project]</span> - Contains all files that are compiled into an executable, library, etc.

18. <span style="color: orange;">[Namespaces]</span> - Logical grouping of classes, must use 'using' keyword to access different classes.

19. <span style="color: orange;">[Classes]</span> - They are the building blocks of your code.
They are the blueprints to creating objects that your process in your program
