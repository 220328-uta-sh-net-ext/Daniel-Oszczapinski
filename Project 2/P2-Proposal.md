## Synopsis

Our plan for project is to create a translation application. This application will use the camera to scan words throughout the world and translate them based on the language you understand. The idea is that if the user goes to another country like Japan/China, the user can scan the symbols and words to read them in their own language. It can be further developed to improve the application to allow for languages that are written or voiced by a user and give the user a translation by voice or text. Even further we can potentially use the words that are translated to give options to our user based on the words. For example, if the word is a food item, the user can search that item from a recipe or fact. It can have lots of possible features but our group will first focus on building a translation app that successfully works with our initial goal of translating words around the world.

## Tech Stack

- Backend/Server:
  - C#, ASP.NET core
  - Sql Sever
  - Docker, Github Action, Git

- Frontend:
  - Javascript
  - HTML

- API's:
  - Canvas API - The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML canvas element. Among other things, it can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.
  - Google Translation API - Google Translation API helps translate text from one language to another instantly.  It uses Googleâ€™s pre-trained neural machine translation to do the translation.
  - text-to-speech api - Improve customer interactions with intelligent, lifelike responses. Engage users with voice user interface in your devices and applications. Personalize your communication based on user preference of voice and language
  - Vision API - Use machine learning to understand your images with industry-leading prediction accuracy Train machine learning models that classify images by your custom labels using AutoML Vision. Detect objects and faces, read handwriting, and build valuable image metadata with Vision API
  - Google Search Api - The Custom Search JSON API lets you develop websites and applications to retrieve and display search results from Programmable Search Engine programmatically. With this API, you can use RESTful requests to get either web search or image search results in JSON format.
